The Rindow OpenBLAS FFI is universal Buffer for N-dimension and OpenBLAS and Mathematical library.
It can be used via PHP's FFI interface.

- Provides Universal Buffer for 1-dimension for data exchange between C,C+ language and PHP.
- The OpenBLAS library available to PHP. Only the commonly used functions in OpenBLAS are provided.
- Provides commonly used Mathematical libraries not included in OpenBLAS.

You can do very fast N-dimensional array operations in conjunction with the [Rindow Math Matrix](https://github.com/rindow/rindow-math-matrix).

Very useful when you want to do deep learning with PHP!

Requirements
============

- PHP 8.1 or PHP8.2 or PHP8.3 or PHP8.4
- OpenBLAS

How to download and setup
=========================

### Windows
The OpenBLAS Library release number is included in the filename of the rindow-openblas pre-built archive file.

- https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/releases

Unzip it to a suitable location and set the execution path in the bin directory.

```shell
TMP>set PATH=%PATH%;\path\to\OpenBLAS\bin
```

And then set it up using composer.

```shell
C> mkdir \your\app\dir
C> cd \your\app\dir
C> composer require rindow/rindow-openblas-ffi
```

### Linux
Install openblas with apt command
```shell
$ sudo apt install libopenblas0 liblapacke
```

And then set it up using composer.
```shell
$ mkdir \your\app\dir
$ cd \your\app\dir
$ composer require rindow/rindow-openblas-ffi
```


### Troubleshooting for Linux

Since rindow-matlib currently uses ptheads, so you should choose the pthread version for OpenBLAS as well.
In version 1.0 of Rindow-matlib we recommended the OpenMP version, but now we have changed our policy and are recommending the pthread version.

Using the OpenMP version of OpenBLAS can cause conflicts and become unstable and slow.
This issue does not occur on Windows.

If you have already installed the OpenMP version of OpenBLAS, you can delete it and install pthread version.
```shell
$ sudo apt install libopenblas0-pthread liblapacke
$ sudo apt remove libopenblas0-openmp
```

But if you can't remove it, you can switch to it using the update-alternatives command.

```shell
$ sudo update-alternatives --config libopenblas.so.0-x86_64-linux-gnu
$ sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so.3-x86_64-linux-gnu
```

If you really want to use the OpenMP version of OpenBLAS, please switch to the serial version of rindow-matlib.

But, If you really want to use the pthread version of OpenBLAS, please switch to the serial version of rindow-matlib.

```shell
$ sudo update-alternatives --config librindowmatlib.so
There are 2 choices for the alternative librindowmatlib.so (providing /usr/lib/librindowmatlib.so).

  Selection    Path                                             Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/lib/rindowmatlib-openmp/librindowmatlib.so   95        auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/rindowmatlib-openmp/librindowmatlib.so   95        manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/rindowmatlib-serial/librindowmatlib.so   90        manual mode
  3            /usr/lib/rindowmatlib-thread/librindowmatlib.so   100       manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 2
```
Choose the "rindowmatlib-serial".
